# Update Landing Page Copy: Emphasize AI Personalization from Real Data

## Problem
The current landing page copy describes "personalized emails" but doesn't make it clear HOW they're personalized — using the candidate's actual LinkedIn profile data, career history, skills, and credentials. This is a key differentiator.

## Changes

### 1. Feature #4: "Personalized Email Outreach" (Landing.tsx)
**Current:** "Connect your Gmail and send personalized recruitment emails directly from MediLead -- no copy-pasting needed."

**Updated:** "AI reads each candidate's LinkedIn profile, skills, and career history — then writes a unique recruitment email. Send it via Gmail without leaving MediLead."

### 2. Feature #6: "Complete Workflow" (Landing.tsx)
**Current:** "From candidate search to outreach to tracking responses -- everything in one place. No spreadsheets required."

**Updated:** "Search, enrich, personalize, send, and track responses -- all without leaving MediLead. No spreadsheets, no copy-pasting."

### 3. How It Works - Step 4 (Landing.tsx)
**Current:** "Connect Gmail and send AI-generated, personalized recruitment emails -- then track opens and replies."

**Updated:** "AI writes a unique email for each candidate based on their real profile. Send via Gmail and track opens and replies -- all inside MediLead."

### 4. Bottom CTA Section (Landing.tsx)
**Current subtitle:** "Join healthcare recruiters who fill roles 3x faster with AI-powered candidate search."

**Updated subtitle:** "Join healthcare recruiters who fill roles 3x faster with AI that finds candidates and writes personalized outreach from their real profiles."

## Technical Details
- Single file change: `src/pages/Landing.tsx`
- Update 4 strings in the `features`, `steps`, and CTA sections
